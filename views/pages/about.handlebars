            <h1>Bonjour! Je vous remercie de votre visite!</h1>
            <p>See that guy? It's me! I am Gervin Fung Da Xuen and I'm not a French</p>
            <p>I am an undergraduate studying Software Engineering. Java is my primary language in programming and currently I am trying to learn web development and python.</p>
            <p>Never in a million years would I have thought the subject that I once hated the most would become my hobby. My 1<sup>st</sup> Program, a.k.a. The 'Hello World' Program was written in C language during my foundation UTAR</p>
            <p>However during that time I am not interested in programming, it wasn't until I decided to do some projects myself, that I discover programming can also be very fun, the sheer joy of making things in your own design is simply fantastic and frustrating</p>
            <p>The Projects in Portfolio Page are what I have programmed during my free time. Hoped you enjoyed!</p>
